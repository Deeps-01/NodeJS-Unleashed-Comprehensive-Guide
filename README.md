How to install Nodejs#

To install Node.js, you can follow these steps depending on your operating system:

1. Install Node.js on Windows:

Visit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org
On the homepage, you will see two versions available for download: LTS (Long Term Support) and Current. For most users, it's recommended to download the LTS version as it is more stable.
Click on the "LTS" button to download the installer for the LTS version.
Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard.
During the installation, you can choose the default settings or customize the installation path if needed.
Once the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by opening the Command Prompt or PowerShell and typing node -v and npm -v to check the installed Node.js version and npm (Node Package Manager) version, respectively.

2. Install Node.js on macOS:

Visit the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org
On the homepage, you will see two versions available for download: LTS (Long Term Support) and Current. For most users, it's recommended to download the LTS version as it is more stable.
Click on the "LTS" button to download the installer for the LTS version.
Run the downloaded installer and follow the installation wizard.
Once the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by opening Terminal and typing node -v and npm -v to check the installed Node.js version and npm version, respectively.

3. Install Node.js on Linux:

The method to install Node.js on Linux can vary based on the distribution you are using. Below are some general instructions:

Using Package Manager (Recommended):
For Debian/Ubuntu-based distributions, open Terminal and run:
sql
Copy code
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs npm

For Red Hat/Fedora-based distributions, open Terminal and run:
Copy code
sudo dnf install nodejs npm
For Arch Linux, open Terminal and run:
Copy code
sudo pacman -S nodejs npm
Using Node Version Manager (nvm):
Alternatively, you can use nvm (Node Version Manager) to manage Node.js versions on Linux. This allows you to easily switch between different Node.js versions. First, install nvm by running the following command in Terminal:
bash
Copy code
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.0/install.sh | bash
Make sure to close and reopen the terminal after installation or run source ~/.bashrc or source ~/.zshrc depending on your shell.
Now, you can install the latest LTS version of Node.js with:
css
Copy code
nvm install --lts
To switch to the LTS version:
css
Copy code
nvm use --lts
You can verify the installation by typing node -v and npm -v.
Whichever method you choose, once Node.js is installed, you can start building and running Node.js applications on your system.
